Create a Github repo called ‘data-enrichment’ in your account, and write python code that will enrich SPARCS.csv with
public health information from the Neighborhood Atlas and if you want to, but not manditory, you can choose another dataset of your choice

The data that you decide to enrich with, should be based/linked to either a zipcode, county, city, or state level to the SPARCS.csv
